            "detailedDescription": "The dramatic and almost immediate effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery on type 2 diabetes (T2D) can only in part be explained by alterations in the plasma concentrations of known peptides. Thus, other - yet unknown - signals or hormones elicited from the endocrine cells of the small intestine may play an important role for the remission of T2D observed following RYGB. In a recent study, a predicted sequence of liver-enriched antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP-2) was shown to induce a glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in isolated human pancreatic islets. The fragment was subsequently identified to be circulating in human plasma in concentrations comparable to the circulating levels of other known gut secreted hormones, hereby validating that LEAP-2 is an endogenous circulating peptide.\n\nThe investigators hypothesise that LEAP-2 increases insulin secretion during a graded glucose infusion as assessed by plasma insulin and C-peptide compared with saline (placebo) in healthy subjects. The study is designed as a clinical, placebo-controlled, double-blinded cross-over study involving two experimental study days and ten young healthy male participants. The co-primary endpoints are the difference in plasma insulin levels during a graded glucose infusion and beta-cell secretion assessed by plasma C-peptide concentration relative to plasma glucose concentration between the two study days with either saline (placebo) or LEAP-2 infusion."

            "abstract": "Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) is a newly discovered antagonist of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) and is considered the first endogenous peptide that can antagonize the metabolic actions of ghrelin. The effects of ghrelin administration on feeding behavior, body weight, and energy metabolism involve the activation of orexigenic neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus. It is unclear, however, if LEAP2 applied directly to the ARC of the hypothalamus affects these metabolic processes. Here, we show that overexpression of LEAP2 in the ARC through adeno-associated virus (AAV) reduced food intake and body weight in wild-type (WT) mice fed chow and a high-fat diet (HFD) and improved metabolic disorders. LEAP2 overexpression in the ARC overrides both central and peripheral ghrelin action on a chow diet. Interestingly, this AAV-LEAP2 treatment increased proopiomelanocortin (POMC) expression while agouti-related peptide (AGRP)/neuropeptide Y (NPY) and GHSR levels remained unchanged in the hypothalamus. Additionally, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of LEAP2 decreased food intake, increased POMC neuronal activity, and repeated LEAP2 administration to mice induced body weight loss. Using chemogenetic manipulations, we found that inhibition of POMC neurons abolished the anorexigenic effect of LEAP2. These results demonstrate that central delivery of LEAP2 leads to appetite-suppressing and body weight reduction, which might require activation of POMC neurons in the ARC.",

We have also examined the effects of LEAP2 overexpression and diet on hypothalamic AGRP/NPY, POMC, and GHSR levels. We showed for the first time that administration of AAV vectors encoding LEAP2 to the ARC tempered food intake and long-term body weight gain together with elevation of hypothalamic POMC expression in mice fed chow and an obesogenic diet. Additionally, we investigated food intake, body weight, and c-Fos expression in the ARC POMC neurons after injecting the LEAP2 peptide into the third ventricle. Also, the effect of LEAP2 on POMC neuronal activity was measured by calcium imaging "

We further demonstrate that LEAP2 enhances POMC neuronal activity and that these neurons mediate the anorexigenic effect of LEAP2.

            "abstract": "Liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2) is a newly discovered antagonist of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR) and is considered the first endogenous peptide that can antagonize the metabolic actions of ghrelin. The effects of ghrelin administration on feeding behavior, body weight, and energy metabolism involve the activation of orexigenic neurons in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus. It is unclear, however, if LEAP2 applied directly to the ARC of the hypothalamus affects these metabolic processes. Here, we show that overexpression of LEAP2 in the ARC through adeno-associated virus (AAV) reduced food intake and body weight in wild-type (WT) mice fed chow and a high-fat diet (HFD) and improved metabolic disorders. LEAP2 overexpression in the ARC overrides both central and peripheral ghrelin action on a chow diet. Interestingly, this AAV-LEAP2 treatment increased proopiomelanocortin (POMC) expression while agouti-related peptide (AGRP)/neuropeptide Y (NPY) and GHSR levels remained unchanged in the hypothalamus. Additionally, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of LEAP2 decreased food intake, increased POMC neuronal activity, and repeated LEAP2 administration to mice induced body weight loss. Using chemogenetic manipulations, we found that inhibition of POMC neurons abolished the anorexigenic effect of LEAP2. These results demonstrate that central delivery of LEAP2 leads to appetite-suppressing and body weight reduction, which might require activation of POMC neurons in the ARC.",

            "abstract": "The hormone liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide-2 (LEAP2) is a recently identified antagonist and an inverse agonist of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). GHSR's other well-known endogenous ligand, acyl-ghrelin, increases food intake, body weight, and GH secretion and is lowered in obesity but elevated upon fasting. In contrast, LEAP2 reduces acyl-ghrelin-induced food intake and GH secretion and is found elevated in obesity but lowered upon fasting. Thus, the plasma LEAP2/acyl-ghrelin molar ratio could be a key determinant modulating GHSR signaling in response to changes in body mass and feeding status. In particular, LEAP2 may serve to dampen acyl-ghrelin action in the setting of obesity, which is associated with ghrelin resistance. Here, we sought to determine the metabolic effects of genetic LEAP2 deletion.\nWe generated the first known LEAP2-KO mouse line. Food intake, GH secretion, and cellular activation (c-fos induction) in different brain regions following s.c. acyl-ghrelin administration in LEAP2-KO mice and wild-type littermates were determined. LEAP2-KO mice and wild-type littermates were submitted to a battery of tests (such as measurements of body weight, food intake, and body composition; indirect calorimetry, determination of locomotor activity, and meal patterning while housed in metabolic cages) over the course of 16 weeks of high-fat diet and/or standard chow feeding. Fat accumulation was assessed in hematoxylin & eosin-stained and oil red O-stained liver sections from these mice.\nLEAP2-KO mice were more sensitive to s.c. ghrelin. In particular, acyl-ghrelin acutely stimulated food intake at a dose of 0.5\u00a0mg/kg BW in standard chow-fed LEAP2-KO mice while a 2\u00d7 higher dose was required by wild-type littermates. Also, acyl-ghrelin stimulated food intake at a dose of 1\u00a0mg/kg BW in high-fat diet-fed LEAP2-KO mice while not even a 10\u00d7 higher dose was effective in wild-type littermates. Acyl-ghrelin induced a 90.9% higher plasma GH level and 77.2\u2013119.7% higher numbers of c-fos-immunoreactive cells in the arcuate nucleus and olfactory bulb, respectively, in LEAP2-KO mice than in wild-type littermates. LEAP2 deletion raised body weight (by 15.0%), food intake (by 18.4%), lean mass (by 6.1%), hepatic fat (by 42.1%), and body length (by 1.7%) in females on long-term high-fat diet as compared to wild-type littermates. After only 4 weeks on the high-fat diet, female LEAP2-KO mice exhibited lower O\nLEAP2 deletion sensitizes lean and obese mice to the acute effects of administered acyl-ghrelin on food intake and GH secretion. LEAP2 deletion increases body weight in females chronically fed a high-fat diet as a result of lowered energy expenditure, reduced locomotor activity, and increased food intake. Furthermore, in female mice, LEAP2 deletion increases body length and exaggerates the hepatic fat accumulation normally associated with chronic high-fat diet feeding.\nA novel line of LEAP2-knockout mice was generated.\nLEAP2 deletion sensitizes mice to the GH secretory effects of administered ghrelin.\nLEAP2 deletion reduces ghrelin resistance in diet-induced obese mice.\nHFD-fed female LEAP2-KO mice eat more and gain more body weight and hepatic fat.\nHFD-fed female LEAP2-KO mice exhibit lowered energy expenditure and activity.",

                  "To our knowledge, this study represents the first report of a LEAP2-KO mouse model. LEAP2-KO mice exhibited increased sensitivity to the actions of administered acyl-ghrelin to stimulate GH secretion, induce food intake, and activate cells in the ARC and OB. This was particularly evident in diet-induced obesity, in which not even an exceedingly high dose of acyl-ghrelin [",
                  "A prominent finding of the current study was the increased sensitivity to administered acyl-ghrelin observed in the LEAP2-KO mice. Specifically, the observed orexigenic responses in LEAP2-KO mice to acyl-ghrelin doses that were ineffective in wild-type mice, particularly in mice chronically fed high-fat diet, supports the hypothesis that LEAP2 is a key determinant of ghrelin resistance. Also supporting this hypothesis, LEAP2-KO mice exhibited increased ARC and OB c-fos-immunoreactivity and increased plasma GH following acyl-ghrelin administration. These novel findings support and bolster the findings of Ge et\u00a0al. in which administration of anti-LEAP2 neutralizing antibodies raised plasma GH [",
                  "One intriguing clue to the cause of the discrepancy between the metabolic outcomes of LEAP2 deletion in high-fat diet-fed females vs. high-fat diet-fed males may be the different mean plasma acyl-ghrelin levels observed in those two groups. For example, 16 week-old, ",
                  "Another finding of interest in the current study was the increased hepatic fat accumulation in high-fat diet-fed female LEAP2-KO mice vs. wild-type mice. Specifically, 29% of the imaged liver area was oil red O-positive in LEAP2-KO mice vs. 20% in wild-type littermates. Plus, livers from high-fat diet-fed female LEAP2-KO mice contained marked increases in the numbers of lipid droplets sized >15,000\u00a0\u03bcm",
                  "Finally, it is noteworthy that s.c. acyl-ghrelin administration to LEAP2-KO mice induced greater c-fos expression not only in the ARC but also in the OB. First, regarding our objective analyses of the c-fos data, all statistical tests for ARC and OB (main effects of genotype and treatment and their interaction in two-way ANOVA models) were statistically significant. The statistical significance at alpha\u00a0=\u00a00.05, with a sample size of 5 per group (total\u00a0=\u00a020), clearly demonstrates high power for these inferences. However, to get an initial estimate of post hoc power, we calculated partial eta squared for each test and associated power based on these observed effect sizes. Partial eta squared estimates ranged from 0.26 to 0.80 and corresponding power ranged from 0.70 to 1.00. However, it should be noted that post hoc power analyses based on observed effects sizes with small sample size is limited in scope and interpretation due to the high variance in the estimated effect sizes and subsequent power calculations. Second, to our knowledge, acyl-ghrelin-induced c-fos induction in the OB has not yet been reported. One study however did report that nasal application of an acyl-ghrelin solution nearly doubled the percentage of c-fos-positive juxtaglomerular OB cells in mice induced by the odorant 2,3-hexanedione ["

Also, our findings show that LEAP2 deletion decreases energy expenditure and increases weekly food intake, body weight, lean mass, hepatic fat accumulation, and body length in high-fat diet-fed female mice, but has no biologically significant effects on those parameters in high-fat diet-fed male mice or standard chow-fed female and male mice. Whether these effects in high-fat diet-fed female mice are a function of a loss of LEAP2's usual effects to block acyl-ghrelin action and/or to reduce GHSR constitutive activity remains to be determined. Also, whether the physiologic effects of deleting the "

            "title": "LEAP2 deletion in mice enhances ghrelin's actions as an orexigen and growth hormone secretagogue",
            "abstract": "The hormone liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide-2 (LEAP2) is a recently identified antagonist and an inverse agonist of the growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR). GHSR's other well-known endogenous ligand, acyl-ghrelin, increases food intake, body weight, and GH secretion and is lowered in obesity but elevated upon fasting. In contrast, LEAP2 reduces acyl-ghrelin-induced food intake and GH secretion and is found elevated in obesity but lowered upon fasting. Thus, the plasma LEAP2/acyl-ghrelin molar ratio could be a key determinant modulating GHSR signaling in response to changes in body mass and feeding status. In particular, LEAP2 may serve to dampen acyl-ghrelin action in the setting of obesity, which is associated with ghrelin resistance. Here, we sought to determine the metabolic effects of genetic LEAP2 deletion. We generated the first known LEAP2-KO mouse line. Food intake, GH secretion, and cellular activation (c-fos induction) in different brain regions following s.c. acyl-ghrelin administration in LEAP2-KO mice and wild-type littermates were determined. LEAP2-KO mice and wild-type littermates were submitted to a battery of tests (such as measurements of body weight, food intake, and body composition; indirect calorimetry, determination of locomotor activity, and meal patterning while housed in metabolic cages) over the course of 16 weeks of high-fat diet and/or standard chow feeding. Fat accumulation was assessed in hematoxylin & eosin-stained and oil red O-stained liver sections from these mice. LEAP2-KO mice were more sensitive to s.c. ghrelin. In particular, acyl-ghrelin acutely stimulated food intake at a dose of 0.5\u00a0mg/kg BW in standard chow-fed LEAP2-KO mice while a 2\u00d7 higher dose was required by wild-type littermates. Also, acyl-ghrelin stimulated food intake at a dose of 1\u00a0mg/kg BW in high-fat diet-fed LEAP2-KO mice while not even a 10\u00d7 higher dose was effective in wild-type littermates. Acyl-ghrelin induced a 90.9% higher plasma GH level and 77.2\u2013119.7% higher numbers of c-fos-immunoreactive cells in the arcuate nucleus and olfactory bulb, respectively, in LEAP2-KO mice than in wild-type littermates. LEAP2 deletion raised body weight (by 15.0%), food intake (by 18.4%), lean mass (by 6.1%), hepatic fat (by 42.1%), and body length (by 1.7%) in females on long-term high-fat diet as compared to wild-type littermates. After only 4 weeks on the high-fat diet, female LEAP2-KO mice exhibited lower O LEAP2 deletion sensitizes lean and obese mice to the acute effects of administered acyl-ghrelin on food intake and GH secretion. LEAP2 deletion increases body weight in females chronically fed a high-fat diet as a result of lowered energy expenditure, reduced locomotor activity, and increased food intake. Furthermore, in female mice, LEAP2 deletion increases body length and exaggerates the hepatic fat accumulation normally associated with chronic high-fat diet feeding.   A novel line of LEAP2-knockout mice was generated. LEAP2 deletion sensitizes mice to the GH secretory effects of administered ghrelin. LEAP2 deletion reduces ghrelin resistance in diet-induced obese mice. HFD-fed female LEAP2-KO mice eat more and gain more body weight and hepatic fat. HFD-fed female LEAP2-KO mice exhibit lowered energy expenditure and activity.",
