## Concordance History

### v9 Concordance (Batch A, 25 NCTs, job #1)

| Field | vs R1 | vs R2 |
|---|---|---|
| Classification | 91.7% / AC₁ 0.91 | — |
| Peptide | 78.9% / κ 0.41 | — |
| Outcome | 81.8% / κ 0.76 | — |
| Delivery mode | 45.0% / κ 0.34 | — |
| Reason for failure | 60.9% / κ 0.43 | — |

### v10 Concordance (400 NCTs, jobs #5+6)

| Field | vs R1 | vs R2 | Human R1↔R2 | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Classification | 89.0% / AC₁ 0.883 | 85.2% / AC₁ 0.839 | 91.6% | 0/14 AMP subtypes |
| Reason for failure | **89.4%** / AC₁ 0.891 | **91.5%** / AC₁ 0.912 | 87.2% | **Exceeds human** |
| Peptide | 65.0% / κ 0.274 | 74.2% / κ 0.421 | 83.4% | Under-calling True |
| Delivery mode | 57.3% / κ 0.472 | 63.3% / κ 0.539 | 71.3% | Improved from v9 |
| Outcome | 47.3% / κ 0.287 | 57.7% / κ 0.373 | 56.2% | **Regressed** |

### v11+eff Concordance (job 1ff6092a499c, 25 NCTs — WRONG BATCH)

**CAUTION:** This job used different NCTs than fast_learning_batch_25.txt — only 12/25 overlap with v9 Batch A. Not valid for 3-way comparison.

| Field | vs R1 | vs R2 | vs v9 R1 | Trend |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Classification | 88.0% / κ -0.06 | 88.0% / κ 0.36 | 92.0% | Stable |
| **Outcome** | **52.0% / κ 0.41** | **60.0% / κ 0.49** | **80.0%** | **Regressed: 9/9 Unknowns wrong. Phase I guard disaster.** |
| Peptide | 76.0% / κ 0.00 | 75.0% / κ 0.00 | 68.2% | Mixed |
| **Delivery mode** | **64.0% / κ 0.48** | **84.0% / κ 0.77** | **44.0%** | **Improved significantly** |
| Reason for failure | 48.0% / κ 0.27 | 60.0% / κ 0.49 | 56.0% | Regressed (cascade from outcome) |

**Root cause analysis (outcome regression):**
- 6/9 wrong Unknowns from Phase I guard deterministic rule (COMPLETED Phase I without hasResults → Unknown)
- 3/9 from LLM also defaulting Unknown (confidence cap too harsh: single-source / 2 = 0.5)
- hasResults is frequently unpopulated even when publications exist
- All 9 Unknowns disagree with BOTH human annotators unanimously

**Root cause analysis (reason_for_failure regression):**
- 5/14 errors are cascade from outcome: Unknown → consistency rule blanks RFR
- 3/14 from Withdrawn trials getting blank RFR (humans annotated real reasons)
- Remaining are legitimate R1/R2 disagreements

**v12 fixes applied:** Phase I guard removed, confidence cap removed, Withdrawn removed from RFR skip list, self-audit evidence keywords widened.

## v11 Efficiency Improvements

| Change | Before | After | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|
| Verification model switches | ~15/trial | ~3/trial | ~30% trial time |
| Annotation model switches | 2-3/trial | 0/trial | ~60-90s/trial |
| Reconciliation | per-field inline | batched (1 load) | Variable |
| Progress reporting | NCT + stage only | Field/agent/model/timings | Visibility |

**Answered:** qwen2.5:14b delivery_mode improved significantly (64% vs 44%). Outcome regression was NOT model-related — caused by deterministic rules and confidence formula.

## v10 → v11 Deterministic Impact Analysis (400 NCTs)

| Fix | NCTs Affected | % |
|-----|---------------|---|
| Phase I guard (Positive→Unknown) | 107 | 27% |
| Known peptide drugs (False→True) | 13 | 3% |
| Total would change | 120 | 30% |

## EDAM Database State (2026-03-24 — WIPED CLEAN)

| Table | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| experiences | 0 | Fresh start — will populate from v12 onwards |
| corrections | 0 | |
| stability_index | 0 | |
| embeddings | 0 | |
| prompt_variants | 0 | |
| config_epochs | 0 | Epoch counter reset — v12 will be epoch 1 |

### Why EDAM was wiped

All prior EDAM data (2,840 experiences, 43 corrections, 2,590 stability entries) was generated by code versions with known bugs (v9-v11). The data taught patterns that v12 code contradicts:
- v11 Phase I guard produced wrong "Unknown" experiences (now removed)
- 28 peptide True→False corrections repeated a pattern already purged once (128 in v11)
- Stability index compared runs across different code versions — meaningless signal

**EDAM's role going forward:** Supplementary edge-case memory, NOT the primary improvement loop. Code changes are primary. EDAM will learn ONLY from v12+ runs on stable code.

## Plan

### Approach: Code-first iteration, EDAM supplementary

**Key principle:** Agents improve primarily through code changes (prompts, rules, models, logic) analyzed via concordance after each run. EDAM captures edge-case patterns the code can't handle deterministically. Do NOT run large batches until the code is stable — each code change invalidates prior runs and wastes compute.

**Convergence criteria for "code stable":** Two consecutive Batch A runs (25 NCTs) with <2% concordance change between them across all fields.

### Phase 1: Iterate on Batch A until stable (NEXT)

**Run v12 Batch A** on correct NCTs (`fast_learning_batch_25.txt`):
```bash
cd "/Users/amphoraxe/Developer/amphoraxe/llm.amphoraxe.ca/amp_llm_v3/standalone modules/agent_annotate"
NCT_IDS=$(python3 -c "
with open('scripts/fast_learning_batch_25.txt') as f:
    ncts = [l.strip() for l in f if l.strip()]
import json; print(json.dumps(ncts))
")
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8005/api/jobs \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"nct_ids\": $NCT_IDS}"
```

After each run:
1. **3-way concordance** vs v9 (#1) + v10 (#3) on same 25 NCTs
2. **Error analysis**: categorize each disagreement as code-fixable vs edge-case
3. **If code-fixable**: implement fix, bump version, re-run Batch A (~3h/cycle)
4. **If edge-case only**: EDAM is handling it, move to Phase 2
5. **Expected v12 targets on Batch A:**
   - Outcome: ≥80% vs R1 (was 80% in v9, 52% in v11 — Phase I guard removed)
   - Delivery mode: ≥60% vs R1 (was 64% in v11+eff — model improvement retained)
   - Reason for failure: ≥60% vs R1 (cascade errors resolve with outcome fix)
   - Classification: ≥90% vs R1 (stable across versions)
   - Peptide: ≥75% vs R1 (v10 was 82%, check if v12 retains)

### Phase 2: Expand to Batch A+B (50 NCTs)

Once Batch A meets targets:
1. Run on 50 NCTs (`fast_learning_batch_50.txt`) to confirm improvements generalize
2. Minor code tweaks only — no major rewrites
3. If concordance holds, proceed to Phase 3

### Phase 3: Full 964-NCT single-version run

**Run ALL 964 human-annotated NCTs in one version** — no piecemeal batches across different code versions.
- Submit 4-5 jobs (200 NCTs each) sequentially
- ~40h total (~460s/trial)
- This gives a clean, single-version concordance across the entire dataset
- **No selective re-annotation** — everything is fresh on the same code

**Targets (full 964):**
- Outcome: >70% vs R1 (human R1↔R2 = 56.2%)
- Peptide: >75% vs R1 (human R1↔R2 = 83.4%)
- Classification: AC₁ > 0.88
- Delivery mode: >60% vs R1 (human R1↔R2 = 71.3%)
- Reason for failure: >80% vs R1 (v10 already hit 89.4%)

### Phase 4: EDAM cleanup + final calibration

After Phase 3 concordance:
1. **Purge EDAM:** Remove all experiences/corrections from epochs 1-3 (v9/v10/v11). These were generated by inferior code and may teach wrong patterns.
2. **Seed EDAM fresh** from Phase 3 results — clean epoch with stable code
3. **Re-run Batch A** one more time to measure EDAM-only impact (code unchanged)
4. If EDAM helps: keep. If neutral or harmful: disable EDAM injection for Phase 5.

### Phase 5: Annotate 884 unannotated NCTs

Agent-only, no human counterpart. Final code version + clean EDAM (if validated).
- Submit 4-5 jobs (200 NCTs each)
- ~40h total
- No concordance possible (no human reference) — rely on review queue for quality

### What NOT to do anymore

- **Don't run 200+ NCT batches during active code iteration** — they'll be invalidated by the next fix
- **Don't selectively re-annotate** subsets from older versions — re-run everything fresh when stable
- **Don't trust EDAM corrections from pre-v12 epochs** — the code they learned from had known bugs
- **Don't add EDAM experiences for fields with deterministic outcomes** (Recruiting, Withdrawn, Terminated) — the code handles these perfectly, EDAM noise can only hurt
