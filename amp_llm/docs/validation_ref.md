## Validation in Practice

### Command Line

```bash
Research >>> validate

üìã Valid Values for All Fields:

Study Status (choose ONE):
  ‚Ä¢ NOT_YET_RECRUITING
  ‚Ä¢ RECRUITING
  ...

[Shows all valid values]
```

### Automated Validation

The system automatically:
1. **Validates on extraction**: Checks values when creating `ClinicalTrialExtraction`
2. **Fuzzy matching**: Attempts to match similar values (e.g., "Phase 1" ‚Üí "PHASE1")
3. **Warnings**: Shows validation warnings if values don't match
4. **Logging**: Logs validation issues for review

### Validation Errors

If extraction has invalid values:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Validation warnings:
  ‚Ä¢ Invalid study_status: 'active' (must be one of: NOT_YET_RECRUITING, RECRUITING, ...)
  ‚Ä¢ Invalid delivery_mode: 'oral' (must be one of: Oral - Tablet, Oral - Capsule, ...)
```

## Best Practices

### For Manual Entry

1. **Copy exact values** from this document
2. **Match capitalization** exactly (e.g., `PHASE1` not `Phase1`)
3. **Use pipe character** for combined phases (e.g., `PHASE1|PHASE2`)
4. **Include parentheses** in classification (e.g., `AMP(infection)`)
5. **Boolean values** must be `True` or `False` (not `Yes`/`No`)

### For AI Extraction

The Modelfile includes these validation rules, so the AI should:
1. Use exact values from validation lists
2. Choose most specific delivery mode available
3. Classify AMPs correctly based on purpose
4. Map status to appropriate outcome
5. Provide failure reason only when applicable

### For Database Import

When importing external data:
```python
from data.clinical_trial_rag import validate_enum_value, StudyStatus

# Validate before creating extraction
status = validate_enum_value(raw_status, StudyStatus, "study_status")
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid study_status" Error

**Problem**: Value doesn't match enum  
**Solution**: Check exact spelling and capitalization

```
‚ùå study_status: 'completed' 
‚úÖ study_status: 'COMPLETED'
```

### "Invalid delivery_mode" Error

**Problem**: Value too generic  
**Solution**: Use most specific option

```
‚ùå delivery_mode: 'oral'
‚úÖ delivery_mode: 'Oral - Tablet'
```

### "Invalid classification" Error

**Problem**: Missing parentheses  
**Solution**: Include exact formatting

```
‚ùå classification: 'AMP infection'
‚úÖ classification: 'AMP(infection)'
```

## Updating Valid Values

To add new valid values:

1. Edit `data/clinical_trial_rag.py`
2. Add to appropriate Enum class:
   ```python
   class DeliveryMode(str, Enum):
       # Existing values...
       NEW_MODE = "New - Mode"
   ```
3. Update `Modelfile` validation section
4. Update this documentation
5. Rebuild custom model
